### An implementation of 'load-more' which follows best practises

The best way for a web page to present a long list of search results has been the subject of much discussion in the web developer community. Pagination which was the traditional technique developed in the early days of the web was followed, later on, by approaches such as 'infinite-scroll' and 'load-more'. All of these techniques have perceived shortcomings, as well as virtues, and thus debates as to which is the superior method are fierce.

[The Baymard institute](http://baymard.com/), a world leader in web usabilty, published their research on product lists and concluded that 'load more' was the best technique, with the caveat that a careful implementation that addressed a variety of usability issues was essential to its effectiveness.

The goal of this project is to produce an implementation of 'load more' which follows the recommendations of the Baymard institute.
